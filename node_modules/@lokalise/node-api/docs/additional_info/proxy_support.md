# Proxy support

If you are behind a firewall and have to use proxy in order to communicate with Lokalise API, that's not a problem! You can take advantage of the [global-agent](https://github.com/gajus/global-agent) package which allows to enable proxy globally without the need to do any changes to your API-related script.

Detailed explanations and usage instructions can be found in the [global-agent docs](https://github.com/gajus/global-agent#usage).
